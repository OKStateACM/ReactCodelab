# What is this directory?

> **TL;DR:** You should probably just ignore this directory.

In the earliest stages, this codelab was supposed to be for both React and Redux. However, since our codelabs are only an hour, I realized that my notes crammed everything in and felt more lecture than workshop. By focusing only on React and by minimizing the use of arbitrary examples over practical examples in the codelab project, I think I've made a better codelab experience. However, I didn't want to totally get rid of the notes I had already written.

The result is this directory.
