# Codelab: Front-End Web Application Development with React and Redux

### March 7, 2018

[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) are two separate Node libraries commonly used in front-end web app development. React manages user interface elements, called components, and Redux manages one single, overarching application state.

#### Required Installations

The libraries we'll be using today are all Node libraries, so we'll need to have Node installed.

**Install Node at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).**
