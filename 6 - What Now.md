# 6. What Now?

In the past few sections, we've explored components, how they receive information through props, and how they store local variables in the state. We've created a rudimentary news feed that dynamically displays posts from a JSON array.

Where do we go from here? The rest is up to you, but here are some ideas to get started:

* Implement an HTTP request library like [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to get actual information from an actual API.

* [Create an API for this site](https://github.com/OKStateACM/CreateYourOwnAPI_Codelab) so you can store comments and such.

* Create a more proper `<Comment/>` component.

* Implement user profile pages. [I recommend learning React Router for this.](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

* Learn one of the many libraries that accompany React, like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
